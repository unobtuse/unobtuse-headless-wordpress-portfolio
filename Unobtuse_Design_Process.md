## Our Proven WordPress Development Process

At Unobtuse, we believe that every successful website starts with a clear, collaborative process tailored to your unique needs. Here’s what you can expect when partnering with us to bring your vision to life:

### 1. Discovery & Consultation

Our journey begins with a comprehensive consultation, where we take the time to truly understand your project:

- **Purpose & Goals:** We discuss the purpose of your website and define your specific goals and expectations.
- **Timeline:** Together, we’ll determine your ideal launch date and set a realistic project timeline.
- **Inspiration & Competition:** We review competitor sites or examples you admire, ensuring we’re aligned on your vision.
- **Current State Analysis:** If you have an existing website, we’ll evaluate it to identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement.
- **Assets & Content:** We assess any existing branding, images, or content you have, and help you plan for any additional assets or content that may be needed.
- **Monetization & Marketing:** We discuss potential revenue strategies, such as online advertising or e-commerce.
- **Branding:** We evaluate your current branding or discuss options for new logo and brand identity design.
- **Integrations:** We explore opportunities for workflow streamlining, including CRM, AI, analytics, and other integrations.
- **Theme Direction:** Whether you prefer a customized child theme (like Avada or Woodmart) or a fully custom design, we’ll identify the best path forward.
- **Budget:** We’ll have an open, transparent discussion about your budget and how we can maximize its impact.

### 2. Strategy & Proposal

Following our consultation, we move into the planning phase:

- **Research:** We conduct in-depth market research and analyze your industry and audience.
- **SEO Planning:** We develop a custom SEO strategy to ensure your site attracts the right visitors from day one.
- **Technical Evaluation:** We assess your hosting environment to ensure it meets performance and security needs.
- **Milestone Planning:** We outline clear milestones and deliverables for your project.
- **Value Assessment:** We ensure the solution is fairly priced and delivers maximum value.
- **Detailed Proposal:** You receive a comprehensive proposal outlining scope, timeline, and a transparent quote.

Once you approve the proposal and place a non-refundable down payment, we’re ready to begin!

### 3. Design & Development

With the strategy locked in, our team gets to work:

- **Hosting & Infrastructure:** We set up your hosting, domains, database, and a secure staging area.
- **Third-Party Integrations:** We connect any necessary services (CRM, Live Chat, APIs like ChatGPT, Quickbooks, Zapier, etc.).
- **Analytics & Tracking:** We configure analytics, set up social accounts (if needed), and submit your sitemap to Google for indexing.
- **WordPress Installation:** We install WordPress, essential plugins, advanced caching, and security layers like Wordfence.
- **Logo & Branding (If Applicable):** If logo or branding is part of your project, we deliver those first, ensuring a consistent look and feel throughout your website.

Throughout the build, you’ll enjoy open communication—your feedback and new ideas are always welcome. Likewise, we’ll proactively share suggestions and keep you updated at every milestone.

### 4. Launch & Delivery

As we approach launch:

- **Final Review:** We walk through the completed site together, addressing any last tweaks.
- **Training & Handover:** We provide training (as needed) so you feel empowered to manage your new site.
- **Go Live:** We launch your site, monitor performance, and ensure everything runs smoothly.

Final payment is due upon completion (unless a payment plan has been arranged). Your satisfaction is always 100% guaranteed.
